🔒 PRIVACY POLICY — Loey the Coal Miner

Last Updated: November 2025

Loey the Coal Miner (“the Bot”) values your privacy and is committed to protecting your information. This policy explains what data the Bot collects, how it is used, and how it is stored.

1. Information We Collect

The Bot may collect and store limited, non-sensitive information required to operate core features, including:

User IDs — used to uniquely identify Discord members

XP / Level Data — required for the leveling system

Warnings & Moderation Records — for moderation tools

Custom Welcome Messages & Settings — to personalize server interactions

The Bot does NOT collect or store chat messages, passwords, emails, or any personal details beyond what is necessary for functionality.

2. How Your Data Is Used

Your information is used solely to:

Maintain XP, levels, and progression

Execute moderation commands

Provide custom welcome messages

Enable games, events, and interactive features

Your data is never sold, shared, traded, or used for any form of advertising or tracking.

3. Data Storage & Security

Data is stored locally or within your hosting environment (e.g., Replit, Node Hosting, VPS, or equivalent).

Reasonable technical measures are used to keep data secure.

However, no system can be guaranteed fully secure against every possible risk.

4. Data Retention & Removal

User data is retained only while needed for the Bot’s operation.

You may request deletion of your data at any time by contacting the bot owner.

When data is deleted, all XP, warnings, settings, and related records are permanently removed and cannot be restored.

5. Third-Party Services

The Bot may access external APIs (e.g., meme or image APIs) to provide public content.
These services may have their own privacy policies, and the Bot does not control how they handle any data.

The Bot does not send user data to these services — only fetches content.

6. Children’s Privacy

In accordance with Discord’s Terms of Service:

The Bot is intended for users 13 years of age or older.

Users under 13 are not permitted to use the Bot.

7. Changes to This Policy

This Privacy Policy may be updated periodically. Continued use of the Bot after changes means you accept the updated terms.

8. Contact

For questions, concerns, or requests (including data deletion), please contact the bot owner or a designated server administrator directly on Discord.
